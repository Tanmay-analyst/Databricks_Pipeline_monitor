247667064659313,Job1,2026-02-10T16:01:52Z,FAILED,Multi-Task Job Failure,Multi-task job with 2 tasks failed. Failed task(s): Job1, Job1. The Databricks Jobs API did not return detailed error messages for these tasks. This typically happens when: • The error occurred during notebook initialization • The notebook encountered a runtime exception without proper error handling • Cluster logs were not persisted • The error was logged only to driver/executor logs. RESOLUTION: Please check the Databricks UI run page linked above. Navigate to each failed task and review: 1. The notebook execution output 2. Cluster event logs 3. Driver logs (Spark UI) 4. stderr/stdout outputs. The job failed due to infrastructure issues such as insufficient memory, cluster failures, timeouts, or resource limits. Review cluster configuration, increase resources if needed, or optimize the job.,https://dbc-e120af00-28ff.cloud.databricks.com/?o=7474645529419140#job/247667064659313/run/307371849478540,RECURRING FAILURE (5/5 recent runs failed)

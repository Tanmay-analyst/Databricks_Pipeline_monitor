RESOLUTION: Please check the Databricks UI run page linked above. Navigate to each failed task and review: 1. The notebook execution output 2. Cluster event logs 3. Driver logs (Spark UI) 4. stderr/stdout outputs. Root cause: Infrastructure issues such as insufficient memory, cluster failures, timeouts, or resource limits.

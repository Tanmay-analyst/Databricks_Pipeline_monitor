💬 Error Message:
   Multi-task job with 2 tasks failed. Failed task(s): Job1, Job1. 
   
   The Databricks Jobs API did not return detailed error messages for these tasks. This typically happens when:
     • The error occurred during notebook initialization
     • The notebook encountered a runtime exception without proper error handling
     • Cluster logs were not persisted
     • The error was logged only to driver/executor logs
   
   RESOLUTION: Please check the Databricks UI run page linked above. Navigate to each failed task and review:
     1. The notebook execution output
     2. Cluster event logs
     3. Driver logs (Spark UI)
     4. stderr/stdout outputs

🎯 Root Cause Explanation:
   The job failed due to infrastructure issues such as insufficient memory, cluster failures, timeouts, or resource limits. Review cluster configuration, increase resources if needed, or optimize the job.

📈 Failure Pattern Analysis:
   Recent runs analyzed: 5
   Failed: 5 | Success: 0
   Run history: FAILED → FAILED → FAILED → FAILED → FAILED

Executive Summary:
- Extracted Databricks job monitoring output, validated CSV format, and uploaded file to GitHub repository 'Tanmay-analyst/Databricks_Pipeline_monitor' on branch 'main'.
- All steps completed successfully, operational logs and validation reports generated.

Detailed Analysis:
Step 1: Extraction
- Databricks job monitoring output was parsed and converted to CSV format.
- Ensured all required fields (job_id, job_name, status, start_time, end_time, duration, error_message) were present.

Step 2: Validation
- CSV structure validated: header row, field delimiters, no missing values, proper data types.
- Data completeness checked: all jobs accounted for, no duplicate rows.
- Data integrity checked: timestamps valid, job status accurate, error messages captured.

Step 3: Upload
- Authenticated to GitHub using provided token.
- Uploaded CSV to folder 'Error3' in repository 'Tanmay-analyst/Databricks_Pipeline_monitor' on branch 'main'.
- Commit message: 'Automated Databricks job monitoring report upload'.

Step 4: Logging
- Operation logs generated for extraction, validation, upload steps.
- Error handling checkpoints passed: no authentication or upload failures.

Deliverables:
- CSV file: Report2.csv
- GitHub commit: https://github.com/Tanmay-analyst/Databricks_Pipeline_monitor/tree/main/Error3/Report2.csv
- Log file: extraction_upload_log_2024-06-01.txt
- Validation report: csv_validation_report_2024-06-01.txt

Implementation Guide:
1. Configure Databricks job monitoring agent to output job run data.
2. Use ETL pipeline to extract and transform output to CSV.
3. Validate CSV with automated scripts.
4. Authenticate with GitHub using secure token.
5. Use GitHub File Writer Tool to upload CSV file.
6. Review logs and validation reports for QA.

Quality Assurance Report:
- Extraction tested with sample and production data.
- CSV integrity verified: all rows and columns present, no corruption.
- Upload confirmed: file accessible in GitHub repository.
- Security: token usage logged, no unauthorized access detected.

Troubleshooting and Support:
- Common issues: authentication failure, CSV format errors, upload conflicts.
- Diagnostic procedures: check logs, validate token, review CSV structure.
- Escalation: contact repository admin or Databricks support for unresolved issues.

Future Considerations:
- Automate scheduling for daily/weekly extraction and upload.
- Enhance error handling for large datasets and edge cases.
- Optimize resource usage for scalability.
- Plan for regular maintenance and updates.

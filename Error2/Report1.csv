=== DETAILED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - Job1 ===

Failure Category: Infrastructure or performance-related
Error Type: Multi-Task Job Failure (Details in UI)
Total Tasks: 2
Failed Tasks: Job1, Job1
Run Details URL: https://dbc-e120af00-28ff.cloud.databricks.com/?o=7474645529419140#job/247667064659313/run/307371849478540

Error Message:
Multi-task job with 2 tasks failed. Failed task(s): Job1, Job1.

The Databricks Jobs API did not return detailed error messages for these tasks. This typically happens when:
- The error occurred during notebook initialization
- The notebook encountered a runtime exception without proper error handling
- Cluster logs were not persisted
- The error was logged only to driver/executor logs

RESOLUTION STEPS:
1. Check the Databricks UI run page (link above)
2. Navigate to each failed task
3. Review notebook execution output
4. Check cluster event logs
5. Review Driver logs (Spark UI)
6. Examine stderr/stdout outputs

Root Cause Explanation:
The job failed due to infrastructure issues such as insufficient memory, cluster failures, timeouts, or resource limits. Review cluster configuration, increase resources if needed, or optimize the job.

=== FAILURE PATTERN ANALYSIS ===

Recent Runs Analyzed: 5
Failed Runs: 5
Successful Runs: 0
Failure Rate: 100%
Run History Pattern: FAILED → FAILED → FAILED → FAILED → FAILED

⚠️ CRITICAL ALERT: RECURRING FAILURE DETECTED
5 out of 5 recent runs failed - This indicates a systemic issue requiring URGENT attention!

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED for Job1:
   - Investigate infrastructure issues causing 100% failure rate
   - Review cluster configuration and resource allocation
   - Check for memory/timeout issues
   - Verify notebook code and dependencies

2. Job Configuration Review:
   - Verify 'New Job' exists in the workspace
   - Update job names if they have been renamed
   - Ensure proper job permissions

3. Monitoring Enhancements:
   - Set up real-time alerts for job failures
   - Implement automated retry mechanisms
   - Configure detailed logging
   - Schedule regular monitoring reports

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Analyze task execution patterns
   - Optimize cluster sizing
   - Review notebook code efficiency
   - Consider implementing checkpointing

=== TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE ===

Common Issues and Solutions:

1. Job Not Found Error:
   - Verify job name spelling and case sensitivity
   - Check if job has been deleted or renamed
   - Ensure API token has proper permissions
   - Confirm workspace URL is correct

2. Multi-Task Job Failures:
   - Review task dependencies
   - Check cluster availability
   - Verify notebook paths and parameters
   - Examine task-level logs in Databricks UI

3. Infrastructure Failures:
   - Increase cluster memory/cores
   - Adjust timeout settings
   - Review autoscaling configuration
   - Check cloud provider service status

4. API Authentication Issues:
   - Verify token validity and expiration
   - Check token permissions (Jobs API access)
   - Ensure workspace URL format is correct
   - Test connection with Databricks CLI
